To build:

   $ scons
   $ cp libmongo.so $phpextensions/libmongo.so

This attempts to put mongo.so in /usr/local/lib/php/extensions.  If extensions are in a different folder, you'll have to modify the script, for now.

to run:

   $ php -r 'dl("libmongo.so"); echo find_one();'

(Somewhat limited functionality, at the moment)
